**A modern, powerful window management tool for Windows.**
Link windows together to create seamless workflows. Window Magnet allows you to "bond" a child window to a parent window, ensuring they move, minimize, and restore as a single unit. Perfect for multi-tasking, keeping reference material nearby, or managing complex window layouts.

## 🚀 Features

- **Window Bonding**: Select a "Master" and a "Child" window to link them together.
- **Synchronized Movement**: Moving the Master window automatically moves the Child window, maintaining their relative position.
- **State Synchronization**: Minimizing or restoring the Master window automatically applies the same action to the Child window.
- **Multiple Bonds**: Create multiple Master-Child pairs to organize your entire desktop.
- **Modern UI**: Sleek design with adaptive Dark/Light theme support matching your system.
- **Auto-Update**: Stay up-to-date with the latest features automatically.
